# Project Overview
###### Source: 
[Kaggle - Customer Purchasing Behaviors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hanaksoy/customer-purchasing-behaviors)
###### Features: 
Age, Annual Income, Region, Purchase Behavior, Loyalty Score
  
This project applies regression modeling to understand the impact of age, income, and region on customer loyalty. Our primary stakeholders include marketing teams, customer relationship managers, and business strategists, as they are responsible for optimizing customer retention strategies and improving loyalty programs. This project is relevant to them because accurately predicting loyalty scores will help them allocate resources effectively, tailor marketing campaigns, and enhance customer engagement. While our dataset may provide some insights, its small size (238 entries) raises concerns about its representativeness of the overall customer base (as we lack insight into the target population size). Additionally, the lack of date information introduces uncertainty about the data's relevance to current economic conditions. Lastly, the region is not specified in detail, making it risky to apply the regression results to wider regions or internationally.

To address our business question, we will analyze key factors such as purchase frequency, salary, and region to determine their impact on loyalty scores and validate the results by splitting the dataset into training and validation portions. The primary risks involve the dataset's limited scope and potential outdatedness, which may limit the reliability and generalizability of our conclusions.



# Methodology

- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and ensuring data readiness.
- Pre-analysis, finding correlation: Understanding patterns, correlations, and data distribution.
- Regression analysis and validation: Applying linear regression models to determine key loyalty drivers. and create training and test sets, assessing model accuracy.
- Visualization: Creating plots to represent insights and model results.
- Conclusion

## Technical Stack:

### Programming Language: Python
### Libraries Used:
- Numpy: matrix operations
- Pandas: data analysis
- Matplotlib: creating graphs and plots
- Seaborn: enhancing matplotlib plots
- SKLearn: linear regression analysis
- etc...

# Project Scope
## In-Scope
This project involves conducting regression analysis on customer demographic and purchasing data to identify key factors that impact customer loyalty scores. The analysis will be validated through data splitting and performance metrics to ensure reliability. Additionally, we will provide insights and recommendations for customer retention strategies based on the findings.

## Stakeholders:
- Marketing Teams – Utilize insights for campaign optimization.
- Customer Relationship Managers – Improve customer engagement and retention strategies.
- Business Strategists – Align loyalty programs with customer behaviour trends.
