# Project Overview
- Source: [Kaggle - Customer Purchasing Behaviors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hanaksoy/customer-purchasing-behaviors)
- Features: Age, Annual Income, Region, Purchase Behavior, Loyalty Score
  
This project applies regression modeling to understand the impact of age, income, and region on customer loyalty. Our primary stakeholders include marketing teams, customer relationship managers, and business strategists, as they are responsible for optimizing customer retention strategies and improving loyalty programs. This project is relevant to them because accurately predicting loyalty scores will help them allocate resources effectively, tailor marketing campaigns, and enhance customer engagement. While our dataset may provide some insights, its small size (238 entries) raises concerns about its representativeness of the overall customer base (as we lack insight into the target population size). Additionally, the lack of date information introduces uncertainty about the data's relevance to current economic conditions. Lastly, the region is not specified in detail, making it risky to apply the regression results to wider regions or internationally.

To address our business question, we will analyze key factors such as purchase frequency, salary, and region to determine their impact on loyalty scores and validate the results by splitting the dataset into training and validation portions. The primary risks involve the dataset's limited scope and potential outdatedness, which may limit the reliability and generalizability of our conclusions.
